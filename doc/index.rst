The Lick Observatory Searchable Archive is a project intended to allow easy searching and retrieval of 
data gathered by the Observatory.

Goals
-----
1. Provide a searchable interface to access to the data in the current Lick Archive.

2. Provide continuing access to data gathered in the future.

3. Respect proprietary access for recently gathered data.
