"""
Abstract base class that defines an interface for creating a SQL Alchemy 
row from a file. Subclasses that implement this to add support for
instruments in the archive.

The steps to add a new instrument are:

1) Implement a subclass for this class.

2) Add an import for the subclass to reader.py.
